Differencce between an array and a linked list/
An array is a contigious block on memory (elements stored next to other in memory)
A linked list is collections on nodes where one node points to the next one.

Linked lists are preferable if you need to add new data frequently and don't have an end size in mind.
Arrays are more useful when you know the number of entities, arrays are generally faster because you can use direct indexing.

A dictionary is an associative arrary like structure where the indices are not necessarily unsigned integers.
A stack is a data structure where items are added to the top of the stack and removed from the top (analogous to a stack of plates).
A queue is a a data structure where items are added to the back of the queue and removed from the front (analogous to a queue in a bank).

Binary Tree
A binary tree is a special case of a tree data structure, whereby each root is followed by 2 children (leaf) nodes, one use for this setting a up decision tree.
